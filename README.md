# What is Text Summarisation?
Text summarisation is a process that reduces a block of text, small and large, into a summary that maintains all key points of the original document.

# Types of Text Summarisation

There are two commonly used types of text summarisation:

- **Abstractive**
- **Extractive**

**Abstractive** methods focus on understanding semantics of the original text to then re-tell it in fewer words.

**Extractive** methods selects important text structures (sentences, paragraphs etc.) from the original document, which are then collated into a shorter, summarised version of the original text. Sentence importance is reliant upon linguistic and statistical features of sentences.
